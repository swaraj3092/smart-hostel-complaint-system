## 🎯 Problem

Every university hostel has a paper complaint register. Students walk to the warden's
office, write their issue, and then hear nothing for days. There's no tracking, no
acknowledgement, no accountability. Complaints get lost, repeated, or simply ignored.

**Average resolution time: 5–7 days. Our target: under 24 hours.**

---

## 🎬 Demo

**Student sends:**
```
KP-7 hostel room 312 fan not working urgent
```

**System replies instantly:**
```
✅ Complaint Received!

📋 ID: #A3F8C201
🏷️ Category: ELECTRICAL
⚡ Priority: URGENT
🏢 Assigned to: electrical@university.edu

You will be notified on WhatsApp once resolved. Thank you!
```

**Electrical department receives** a formatted HTML email with a green "✅ Mark as Resolved" button.

**When they click it, the student gets:**
```
✅ Great news!

Your complaint #A3F8C201 has been resolved!

🏷️ Issue: KP-7 hostel room 312 fan not working urgent
🏢 Resolved by: electrical@university.edu

Thank you for reporting. — Hostel Management
```
